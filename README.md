# Physics Simulations
## Introduction
I wrote this code just for fun, and have learnt many things along the way. I plan to include various different forms of physics simulations. 
1. the multibody.py file runs a simulation of a multibody collision system. There are various ways to interact with the running simulation and I've added instructions as comments (I have hope some other people check it out too just for fun).
Usage: 
    > ESC to quit, P to pause, R to reset, G to toggle gravity, C to toggle Dynamic colors (speed based), I to toggle particle creation. Right arrow key to step one (display)frame ahead when paused.

lastly I plan to add some gifs of the simulations
